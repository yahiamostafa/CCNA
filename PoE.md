- ## Power over Ethernet (PoE)
	- Power over Ethernet (PoE) is a technology we use to power devices through regular Ethernet network cables.
	- PoE was invented when the first VoIP phones were introduced. Analog phones are powered directly through the same copper wires we use for voice calls.
	- VoIP phones use Ethernet cables without power, so they required a power adapter. Our old analog phones only required one cable, the VoIP phones two. This was a step backward, which is why PoE was invented.
	- Nowadays, we use PoE for many devices. For example:
		-   VoIP phones
		-   IP cameras
		-   Wireless access points
		-   IoT devices
		-   PoS devices
		-   Raspberry Pi
		-   Arduino devices
		-   Small routers and switches
	- A device that is powered by PoE is called a **powered device (PD)**.
	- A device that provides power on the cable is called **Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE)**. We have two options:
	- **End Span**
		- The PoE endspan method uses a switch **with integrated PoE**. You connect your end device to the switch, and it will detect whether the end device is PoE compatible and, if so, enables power automatically.
	- **Mid Span**
		- The PoE midspan method uses **PoE injectors** to add PoE to regular non-PoE links. You can use these to add PoE to your network **without adding or replacing** your non-PoE switches. These are (usually) intelligent devices, and like a PoE switch, they detect whether the PD requires power and, if so, enables power. PoE injectors are useful when you only have a few devices you want to power.
