### Dynamic Trunking Protocol
- DTP is normally used on Cisco IOS switches to negotiate if the interface should become an access port or trunk.
- By default DTP is enabled and the interfaces of your switches will be in “dynamic auto” or “dynamic desirable” mode.
- There are two ways to disable DTP negotiation:
	-   Configure the interface for access mode.
	-   Use the **switchport nonegotiate** command on the interface.
