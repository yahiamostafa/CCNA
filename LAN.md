1) **SOHO LAN**
- The SOHO (Small Office Home Office) LAN is what most of are familiar with it. It’s what you are using at home for Internet connectivity and perhaps to share some files between computers. In its most simple form, it’s only a switch and two computers.
- For wireless connectivity, we add an access point to our network. This allows the wired and wireless devices to communicate with each other. If you want to leave your LAN and communicate with the outside world, you will need a router.

2) **Enterprise LAN**
- Enterprises typically use the same technology as SOHO LANs but on a larger scale. There might be hundreds or thousands of devices connected to the network that is located in one or multiple buildings.
