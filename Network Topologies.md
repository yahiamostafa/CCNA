## Star Topology
- You will see the star topology often when we talk about switches.
- It’s called a star topology because all communication has to go through the switch, it is the central component of our network.

## Full Mesh
- The full mesh topology means that each device is connected to all other devices.
- The advantage of a full mesh topology is that you have full redundancy.
- The downside of a full mesh topology is that it’s expensive. For each link, you will need to pay for the connection and you require additional interfaces on your routers.

## Partial Mesh
- An alternative to full mesh is the partial mesh topology. This is a trade-off between cost and redundancy.

## Hub and Spoke
- In this topology, we have one central device called the hub, and the other devices are called spokes. The headquarters of this company is in New York. This is where all company resources are located. There are also branch offices that need to access the headquarters resources. In this case, it makes sense to build a hub and spoke topology where the New York router becomes the hub and the Miami and Los Angeles routers are spoke routers.  Traffic between spoke routers is often routed through the hub router because of security reasons. The spoke routers could be simple routers while the headquarters has a powerful firewall that inspects all traffic.

## Hybrid
- In reality, we will mix a lot of the network topologies that we described above.
