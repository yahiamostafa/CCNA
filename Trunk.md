- If you want to VLAN traffic between switches we have to use a **trunk**.
- A trunk connection is simply said nothing more but a normal link but it is able to pass traffic from different VLANs and has a method to separate traffic between VLANs.
- Trunks are required to carry VLAN traffic from one switch to another.
- dot1q(802.1q) tagging protocol, it allows other tags to pass this switch to the other one.
- native vlan is untagged : it should be same on all interfaces.
- dynamic auto --> it will operate like the other end (default)
- dynamic desirable --> it tends to be a trunk except for access.
