- #### Why wireless cables?
	- Cables free (You don't have to use cable to connect to the internet.)
	- You can access the network using your moble or labtop.
- we are using radio waves to transmit out data.
- Wireless is half-duplex since we are sending and receiving on the same frequency.
- We do have a protocol that deals with this called **CSMA/CA** which stands for Carrier Sense Multi Access / Collision Avoidance
- Higher frequencies will give you higher data rates, the higher your frequency the more “waves” you have in a given time cycle
- Enterprise wireless LANs use a WLC (Wireless LAN Controller) and LWAPs (Light-Weight Access Point).
- Management tasks like creating wireless networks, authentication and roaming is all done in the WLC. The LWAPs are responsible of forwarding wireless traffic to and from the LAN.
- The WLC and LWAPs allow us to create a big, scalable wireless network.
- When the router starts, it first initializes ROMMON. This is a bit similar to the BIOS of a computer. It allows the router to perform some basic functions like loading the IOS operating system.
