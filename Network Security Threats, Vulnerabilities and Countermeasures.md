### Attacks
1) **Address spoofing** 
	- For example, an attacker could spoof the MAC address of the default gateway. In doing so, other devices might forward their traffic to the attacker, not the default gateway.
	- you could send many Ethernet frames with random source MAC addresses. The switch will learn MAC addresses until its MAC address table is full.
2)  **Man in the middle (MiTM) attacks**
	- A man in the middle (MiTM) attack allows an attacker to **eavesdrop** on the communication between two devices.
