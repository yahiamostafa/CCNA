### Virtual Local Area Network
- it's used to divide the broadcast domain.
- it increases the broadcast domains and decreases the broadcast size. 
- security (Only vlan members can see the message).
- it's stored in the flash memory. (vlan.dat --> database for vlans).
- VLANs make it easy for network administrators to separate a single switched network into multiple groups to match the functional and security requirements of their systems.
