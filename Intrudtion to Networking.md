### Network Defintion
- is two or more devices that can communicate with each other, share information and have access to the same recources.

### Network Hardware
- To build a network, there are some devices that we need. Let me give you an overview with some of the basic hardware that is used.
- **Switches**:
	- On local networks we typically use switches to connect computers and servers to the network, allowing them to communicate with each other.
- **Routers**
	- they figure out what path to use to get to a certain destination.

### Network Jobs
- #### Network Engineer

	The network engineer is the person that is building and configuring the actual network. For example, in a small office network, the routing & switching network engineer configures the switch(es) and routers so that users are able to access the Internet and some servers. If you work at an ISP (Internet Service Provider), you will be configuring routers to ensure that customers have access to the Internet. Wireless network engineers do site surveys to see what kind of wireless performance they can expect and if there is any interface. They configure wireless access points so that users get access to the network.
	
	To be able to configure these network devices, you have to understand the different networking protocols and learn how to configure them.

- #### Network Sales Engineer

	A network sales engineer requires both technical and sales skills. You have to identify customer needs and requirements and be able to translate these into a solution with different networking products.

- #### System Management

	Networking is mostly about the network traffic itself, using networking equipment like routers and switches to get traffic from A to B, preventing malicious traffic with firewalls and/or encrypting traffic.
	
	What about our servers and computers?
	
	Servers have to be installed with operating systems like Windows or Linux. We need to monitor our servers, making sure they have enough RAM and disk space. When a hard disk crashes, it has to be replaced. User accounts have to be configured and when there is a new application, maybe it has to be installed on all computers in the network.
	
	The management of servers and computers is called **system management**. This is a different job, you need different skills for network management and system management. I’m mentioning it here since sometimes there is some overlap. For example, a network engineer that is working with routers and switches might have to understand how to configure the NIC (network interface card) of a server when connecting it to a switch.
	
	In small companies, it’s common to see that one person is doing both jobs. In larger companies, there is usually a distinct separation between system and network management.
