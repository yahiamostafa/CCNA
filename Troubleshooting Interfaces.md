## Duplex / speed issues
- FastEthernet 0/1 is showing down. This could indicate a layer 1 problem like a broken cable, wrong cable (crossover instead of straight-through) or maybe a bad NIC. Note that this interface is running in **half duplex**.
- **Check your interfaces for speed and duplex issues and see if they show as up/up.**
