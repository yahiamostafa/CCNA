- every time you plug in a cable the led above the interface was orange and after a while became green. What is happening at this moment is that spanning tree is determining the state of the interface.
-   **Listening state**: Only a root or designated port will move to the listening state. The non-designated port will stay in the blocking state.No data transmission occurs at this state for 15 seconds just to make sure the topology doesnâ€™t change in the meantime. After the listening state we move to the learning state.
-   **Learning state:** At this moment the interface will process Ethernet frames by looking at the source MAC address to fill the mac-address-table. Ethernet frames however are not forwarded to the destination. It takes 15 seconds to move to the next state called the forwarding state.
-   **Forwarding state:** This is the final state of the interface and finally the interface will forward Ethernet frames so that we have data transmission!
- When a port is not a designated or root port it will be in **blocking mode**.
